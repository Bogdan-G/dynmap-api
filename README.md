# dynmap-api v3.0 has merged with dynmap v3.0

We finally got around to converting all of the Dynmap components to Gradle, and all 3.0 and later development work
will be done on the single, converged repository, https://github.com/webbukkit/dynmap (the original home of dynmap).  
For any future dynmap-api updates and PRs, look there under the /dynmap-api directory path.
